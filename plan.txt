Test #1: Add dates to threads and replies (done)
*****************************************
// Threads

example of required information: {board: "test9", boardText: "Test Test 9", passwordToDelete: "1239"}

    // update the schemas and models with dates and time
        // delete collections, then manually regenerate the collections
        // regenerate the collections programatically
            // for loops
            // while loops
// replies

example of required information: {
    boardId: "634a7e9c88f0267dea5a3684", boardText: "Test Test 9", repliesToBoardText: "Thats good! 9", passwordToDelete: "1239"}
    
    // update the schemas and models with dates and time
        // delete collections, then manually regenerate the collections
        // regenerate the collections programatically
            // for loops
            // while loops


Test #2: Viewing the 10 most recent threads with 3 replies each
********************************
// sort threads based on replies
    // adding replies (done)
        // different collection (done)
            // merge with the respective threads (done)
                // password/thread/ threadtext and id (done)
                    // create and save new reply (done)
                    // search in the replies for all collections matching thread id/thread text, 
                    // return thread id, thread text, list of replies with their ids
                        // iterate the list of replies and collect replies and their ids    
    
    // sort the 10, most recent threads, with 3 replies each

        // use mongoose collections.sort(), specify the date to the boardDateAndTime  (done and working)  
        
            // create an empty array of replies on board  (done)
                // use mongoose.UpdateMany() inserting empty array (does not work)
            // update the board reply with the replies (done)
                    // push the replies to board array of replies
                    // iterate replies and board
                    // find matches by id
                    // use mongoose.findOneAndUpdate() based on the above id
        // select those with atleast 3 or more replies (done)
        // select the top 10 and return them (done)
        
 
Deleting a thread with the incorrect password
*********************************************
// find board based on the id
    // if board.passowrd is similar to provided one, delete it.
    // otherwise dont        
        
Creating a new reply
********************
// dates don't match 100% to seconds and milliseconds (done)


/** Viewing a single thread with all replies */ (done)
    // not returning response
    // inner workings?
        // partially



/** node mongoose  post delete request returning collection but not creating collection */
    // 1. use .findOneAndUpdate() to update replies
    // 2. use upsert etc on the current approach

/** fcc challenges that are failing */
    //1. POST : /api/threads/:board
        // different format of request details
            // already adapted but still not working
        // usage of redirect
            // seems optional?
            //
            
    // Second last option: check others implementation
    // Last option: post on forum for help 

render the returned threads
